            Explanatory Notes:
            Units
            A  unit  trust  is  made  up  of  equal  portions  called  units  (also  known  as  participatory  interest).  Each  unit  has  a  price,  or  net  asset  value  (NAV)
            based on the underlying value of the assets of the fund.
            Reported Market Values
            The  total  market  value  for  each  of  the  fund(s)  that  you  are  invested  in  is  displayed  on  the  first  page  of  this  statement,  as  at  the  given  statement
            date.  You  will  find  that  the  unit  price(s)  used  to  calculate  the  opening  market  value(s)  are  the  previous  business  dayâ€™s  unit  prices(s),  whereas
            closing  market  values  reflect  the  latest  available  unit  price(s),  where  applicable.  You  may  also  experience  small  rounding  differences  in  values
            should  you  attempt  to  reconcile  any  individual  figures  back  to  the  totals  displayed  on  the  statement.  This  is  due  to  some  values  having  more
            decimal places than are displayed.
            Fees and Charges
            Different  classes  of  units  apply  to  the  Prescient  Portfolios,  which  are  also  subject  to  different  fees  and  charges.  Please  refer  to  the  latest
            Minimum  Disclosure  Document  (MDD)  for  more  information  on  the  Total  Expense  Ratio  (TER)  and  annual  portfolio  charges.  Alternately  a  full
            schedule  of  fees,  charges  and  maximum  commissions  is  available  on  request  from  Prescient.  Performance  fees  reported  represent  the
            performance fee component of the latest available TER.
            Effective Annual Cost (EAC)
            The  Effective  Annual  Cost  (EAC)  is  a  measure  which  has  been  introduced  to  allow  you  to  compare  the  cost  you  incur  when  you  invest  in
            different  financial  products.    It  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  your  investment  amount.    The  EAC  is  made  up  of  four  charges,  which  are
            added  together,  as  shown  in  the  table  above.    Some  of  the  charges  may  vary,  depending  on  your  investment  period.    The  EAC  calculation
            assumes  that  an  investor  terminates  his  or  her  investment  in  the  financial  product  at  the  end  of  the  relevant  periods  shown  in  the  table.    In  the
            event of no maturity, an assumed maturity of 10 years is used.
